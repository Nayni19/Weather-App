# Flutter Weather Application

A Weather Application using Flutter is a mobile app designed to provide users with real-time weather information, forecasts, and other meteorological data for their current location or any location worldwide. Built with the Flutter framework, this app offers a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, making it accessible on both Android and iOS devices.

Key Features of the Weather Application using Flutter:

Real-Time Weather Updates:
The Weather App fetches and displays real-time weather data, including current temperature, weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy), wind speed, humidity, and atmospheric pressure.

Location-based Weather:
Users can access weather information for their current location by allowing the app to use device location services. Alternatively, they can search for weather data for specific cities or locations.
